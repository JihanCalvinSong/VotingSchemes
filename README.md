# VotingSchemes
This repo is for M 362K probability final inquiry project.

We compared three voting schemes (Ranking, Approval, Scaled Approval) with the survey result of favorite types of candies from the public. 
Then we compared the result of each voting schemes by focusing on the measures of central tendency and dispersion and the differences between the results.
